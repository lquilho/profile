      <h3>Web Developer</h3>
      <p>I am just starting a career in web development after attending a 9-week intensive coding bootcamp learning HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES2015, SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails. Designed, implemented and shipped to production a clone of AirBnB and a Rails prototype. Would love to bring to live new ideas. I love to use <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and I am also very much interested in <strong>Front-End development</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Ashtangi</h3>
      <p>I found the benefits of a daily <strong>Ashtanga Yoga</strong> practice around four years ago. Since then I had the opportunity to witness so many positive changes in myself that everyday I commit to it with an increasing dedication. I would love to share this practice with whomever is interested.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card-white">
      <h3>Plant-based living</h3>
      <p>Mainly for the health benefits, approximately at the same time I started my yoga journey, I decided to change to a <strong>plant-based diet</strong>, no to mention the benefits to other beings and to our own planet. For me it was the missing link in my lifestyle. So many positive changes added to the others that, until today, I never felt the need of eating animal products again. I strongly recommend it to everybody!</p>

    <div class="card-white">
      <h3>Kayaker</h3>
      <p>Whenever I have the chance, I love to meet with my fellow kayakers in the north of Portugal. It is a great opportunity to exercise and to experience the magical power of paddling down a river, surrounded with wonderful people and beautiful scenery.</p>
